<h1>Gospel: MT 6:7-15</h1>

<div>
<p>Jesus said to his disciples:<br>“In praying, do not babble like the pagans, who think that they will be heard because of their many words.<br>Do not be like them.<br>Your Father knows what you need before you ask him.<br>“This is how you are to pray:<br>‘Our Father who art in heaven,<br>hallowed be thy name,<br>thy Kingdom come,<br>
thy will be done,<br>
on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
Give us this day our daily bread;<br>
and forgive us our trespasses,<br>
as we forgive those who trespass against us;<br>
and lead us not into temptation,<br>
but deliver us from evil.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>“If you forgive others their transgressions,<br>
your heavenly Father will forgive you.<br>
But if you do not forgive others,<br>
neither will your Father forgive your transgressions.”</p>
</div>
