<h2>Ave Maris Stella</h2>
	<p>Hail, bright star of ocean,  God's own Mother blest, Ever sinless Virgin, Gate of heavenly rest.</p><br>
	<p><i>Taking that sweet Ave  Which from Gabriel came, Peace confirm within us, Changing Eva's name.</i></p>
	<p>Break the captives' fetters, Light on blindness pour, All our ills expelling, Every bliss implore.</p><br>
	<p><i>Show thyself a Mother; May the Word Divine, Born for us thy Infant, Hear our prayers through thine.</i></p><br>
	<p>Virgin all excelling, Mildest of the mild, Freed from guilt, preserve us, Pure and undefiled. Keep our life all spotless,
	</p><br>
	<p><i>Make our way secure, Till we find in Jesus, Joy forevermore.</i></p><br>
	<p>Through the highest heaven To the Almighty Three, Father, Son and Spirit, One same glory be.  Amen.</p>

<h2>Veni Creator Spiritus</h2>
	<p>Creator Spirit, Lord of grace,  Come, make in us your dwelling place! O purest Light, in darkness shine; Full loveless hearts, O Love divine!</p><br>
	<p><i>O Spirit, hear your people’s cry! Come down, O Gift of God most high! Descend in peace, O heavenly Dove; Come, fount of life; come, flame of love! </i></p><br>
	<p>As once on Christ the Servant’s head The oil of sevenfold grace you shed, So now anoint from love’s deep springs Your chosen prophets, priest, and kings!</p><br>
	<p><i>Of every gift the living source,  Of mighty deeds the unseen force, The Father sends his Promised One To speak for all who serve his Son!</i></p><br>
	<p>Keep far all those who wish us ill! O Dove of peace, be with us still! In every danger at our side, O Friend, befriend us; be our guide!</p><br>
	<p><i>Reveal to us the Father’s love, Reveal his Son, who reigns above! To truth, O Truth, make all souls true; In love, O Love, make all things new!</i></p><br>
	<p>To God the Father glory be, And to the Son from death set free; And to the Holy Spirit raise Our praise to God for endless days. Amen.</p>
