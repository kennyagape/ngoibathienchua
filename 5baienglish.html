<h2>St. Louis De Montfort’s Prayer to Jesus</h2>
	<p>O most loving Jesus, deign to let me pour forth my gratitude before Thee, for the grace Thou hast bestowed upon me in giving me to Thy holy Mother through the devotion of Holy Bondage, that she may be my advocate in the presence of Thy majesty and my support in my extreme misery.</p><br>
	<p><i>Alas, O Lord! I am so wretched that without  this dear Mother I should be certainly lost. </i></p><br>
	<p>Yes, Virgin Mary is necessary for me at Thy side and everywhere: that she may appease Thy just wrath, because I have so often offended Thee; that she may save me from the eternal punishment of Thy justice, which I deserve; that she may contemplate Thee, speak to Thee, pray to Thee, approach Thee and please Thee; that she may help me to save my soul and the souls of others; in short, Virgin Mary is necessary for me that I may always do Thy holy will and seek Thy greater glory in all things. </p><br>
	<p><i>Ah, would that I could proclaim throughout the whole world the mercy that Thou hast shown to me! </i></p><br>
	<p>Would that everyone might know I should be already damned, were it not for Virgin Mary!  </p><br>
	<p><i>Would that I might offer worthy thanksgiving for so great a blessing!  </i></p><br>
	<p>Virgin Mary is in me.  </p><br>
	<p>Oh, what a treasure! Oh, what a consolation! And shall I not be entirely hers’? Oh, what ingratitude! My dear Saviour, send me death rather than such a calamity, for I would rather die than live without  belonging entirely to Mary. </p><br>
	<p>With St. John the Evangelist at the foot of the Cross, I have taken her a thousand times for my own and as many times have given myself to her; but if I have not yet done it as Thou, dear Jesus, dost wish, I now renew this offering as Thou dost desire me to renew it.</p><br>
	<p><i>And if Thou see  in my soul or my body anything that does not belong to this august princess, I pray Thee to take it and cast it far from me, for whatever in me does not belong to Mary is unworthy of Thee.</i></p><br>
	<p>O Holy Spirit, grant me all these graces. Plant in my soul the Tree of true Life, which is Mary; cultivate it and tend it so that it may grow and blossom and bring forth the fruit of life in abundance. </p><br>
	<p><i> O Holy Spirit, give me great devotion to Virgin Mary, Thy faithful spouse; give me great confidence in her maternal heart and an abiding refuge in her mercy, so that by her Thoui mayest truly form in me Jesus Christ, great and mighty, unto the fullness of His perfect age. Amen. </i></p>

<h2>Oh Jesus Living in Mary </h2>
	<p>O Jesus living in Virgin Mary, Come and live in Thy servants, In the spirit of Thy holiness, In the fullness of Thy might, In the truth of Thy virtues,</p><br>
	<p><i>In the perfection of Thy ways, In the communion of Thy mysteries; Subdue every hostile power In Thy spirit, for the glory of the Father. Amen. </i></p>
